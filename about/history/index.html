            History
        </h2>
            <p>
            Brightstar Partners started life in January 2000 as the corporate 
            venturing arm of British Telecom (BT Brightstar) and was tasked 
            with commercialising some of the 14,000 patents BT held . BT 
            Brightstar was founded by Dr. Chris Winter and Harry Berry who 
            have remained involved with Brightstar over the following 15 years.
            </p>
            <p>
            Brightstar spun out 10 companies in its first three years of 
            operation before spinning itself out of BT in a private equity deal 
            and merging with New Venture Group, the corporate venturing arm of 
            Lucent Technologies. Both NVG and Brightstar were benchmarked as 
            best in their classes in the US and Europe respectively. The merger 
            led to the formation of New Venture Partners (NVP), a transatlantic 
            venture capital firm with $700m under management and which focussed 
            on corporate spin outs, with Brightstar trading as NVPM-UK Ld the 
            European office of NVP.
            </p>
            <p>
            New Venture Partners invested in around 30 corporate spin outs 
            worldwide, dealing with many of the biggest Fortune 500 companies.
            </p>
            <p>
            Brightstar Partners also ran an innovation and IP exploitation 
            consultancy business (Brightstar Innovations), which provided 
            expertise in IP exploitation, spin outs and innovation to many 
            major corporations.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2013 the team at Brightstar Partners saw an opportunity to 
            repeat the model in the health sector, and to work with parts of 
            the UK National Health Service to exploit its under used IP.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2014 the opportunity to work with the Korean Government to create 
            a similar vehicle in Korea emerged following the visit of President 
            Park to the UK and her establishment of Korea's "Creative Economy" 
            initiative.
            </p>
            <p>
            Subsequently Brightstar Partners closed its first medical 
            technologies fund: the Korean-UK Innovation Fund I focussed on 
            creating companies across the two geographies based on IP from 
            medical insititutions.
            </p>
