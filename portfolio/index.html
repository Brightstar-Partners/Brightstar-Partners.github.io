            DC Medical acquired the KUKI-I fund interests in OrganSol and Sticky Cath. 
            DC Medical has built on the experiences of Brightstar to develop a 
            model for spinning medical device companies out. It has four subsidiaries – the 
            former KUKI-I companies and two further NHS spin-outs: Symimetics and EveryBaby.

            <p>
            Symimetics is developing completely new materials for meshes for stress 
            urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and hernia repair. These materials 
            have been designed to have all the physical properties of human fascia tissues, 
            thus overcoming the issues some patients have with current materials. The 
            materials technology has been 7 years in development in Sheffield University 
            and the Royal Hallamshire Trust.

            Sheffield University and the Royal Hallamshire Trust developed a detector 
            based on electrical impedance spectroscopy which measured the risk of a 
            mother going into premature labour. Prevention or delay of pre-term 
            birth has lifelong benefits in terms of the health of the child, as well 
            as massive cost savings
